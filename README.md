# Hello World in C++

## How to run:

Run the following command:

1. `make`

This will prepare the `debug` and `release` folders and will generate a release build.

To instead generate a debug build, run `make debug`

## How to debug:

The project has been configured to be built and debugged with vscode using the Makefile. Just set a breakpoint and open the debug panel and launch `Debug build`
